# Expanding Cards

A visually appealing project that demonstrates the concept of expanding cards using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- Smooth transition effects when expanding and collapsing cards.
- Displays a heading for each card when it is expanded.
- Fully responsive design with a media query to hide extra cards on smaller screens.

## How It Works

- CSS transitions are used to animate the expansion and collapse of the cards.
- The heading inside each card becomes visible when the card is expanded.
